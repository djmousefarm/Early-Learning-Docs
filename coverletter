Letter draft

Dear David,

Please find enclosed a signed copy of the contract as well as my passport.  I am currently in discussion with the management at REAL to 
determine when I can start working at the Software Bureau and will let you know via email as soon as I have a date.

Here are my two references : 

David Laybourne
REAL Digital International Limited
2 Queensway
Croydon
Surrey
CR0 4BD
Email : David-Laybourne@real-digital.co.uk

John Knight
The Production Hub
Barham Court
Teston
Maidstone
Kent
ME18 5BZ
Email : john@productionhub.org.uk

Let me know if you would rather I tried to find someone references from people you don't know.  I'll try but they're unlikely to
be professional references.

Looking forward to beginning my time working for your company.

Yours sincerely,

Bob Sheridan
