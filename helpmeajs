So it’s sort of final happened.  Today David S asked us (i.e. myself and Nick) about using “javascript” for creating email campaigns.  Obviously I know that this is possible and really, really I want to be able to demonstrate that, especially if I can do so without using printnet dynamic comms.  The thing is that creating something absolutely from scratch without having a web server to be able to pull in nice dynamic data (JSON files) – unless I perform a horrible kludge of it and manually build them into actual javascript file, something which will reveal its lack of usefulness very quickly - nor to be able utilise the likes of bootstrap, jquery, node, etc without having npm to install them, pretty much scuppers me before I’ve really got started.  (I have tried but from what little I’ve read about it Javascript pretty much refuses to ever locally access files, I’m guessing this is a security feature to protect web content, and that’s all I’ve got.)

It’s also really hard to just create something like this utterly from scratch.  Yes I’ve interrogated JSON files as part of the FCC course and have done separate JSON usage courses, but these account for a lot of the missing elements/I was able to install whatever I needed to do it.  I’ve never created something that would effectively churn out customised web pages specifically to then have them become entities in their own right (i.e. emails) and wouldn’t know where to begin with that.  There’s also the fact that this isn’t really my main project, I’ll have to always fit this in around my normal work, and recreating the very dumb development environment I have work would effectively mean destroying my slowly growing own development environment to do so.
